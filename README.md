JavaScript to asynchronously fetch weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API, ensuring real-time updates 
and efficient handling of APIresponses and errors.

• Developed dynamic UI components that display weather information, including temperature,
humidity, and weather conditions, with relevant emojis.

• Incorporated robust error handling mechanisms to manage and display user-friendly error
messages for invalid inputs or failed data fetches, thereby improving the application's reliability and
user interaction.
